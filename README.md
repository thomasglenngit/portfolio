## Known Bugs

This being only my second project using Bootstrap, there are a few entries in my .css stylesheet which do not reflect in the published version of the landing page. I have left them in to show what I was "attempting" to do, without "//" commenting out those particular codes. Obviously, I would like to be more familiar with Bootstrap and anticipate using it more in the future.
