#### _.html file with css and bootstrap3.3.7, 4.9.2020_

#### By _**Thomas Glenn**_

## Description

_{This is my first code review assignment through Epicodus. It incorporates elementary proficiency in .html, .css, Bootstrap version 3.3.7 through the creation of a landing page with links to my other class assignments to date. The landing page itself contains a short résumé and bio, as well as links to all my projects published on gh-pages through my gitHub repositiories.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone file from repository_
* _Open in your browser_
* _Read_
* _Enjoy_
* _Offer feedback_

_This file requires no additional server, app, code or database to run. 'Just simple .html and .css_

## Known Bugs

_This being only my second project using Bootstrap, there are a few entries in my .css stylesheet which do not reflect in the published version of the landing page. I have left them in to show what I was "attempting" to do, without "//" commenting out those particular codes. Obviously, I would like to be more familiar with Bootstrap and anticipate using it more in the future._
