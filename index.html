              <p>About Thomas:
              
            
                A citizen of both the US and Canada, Thomas has spent his entire life pursuing a career in classical music. Wanting to be closer to his family, Thomas decided to make a career change and is now training for a career in tech. Currently, he is a student at the Epicodus school in Portland, Oregon. He enjoys the pairs programming format because it forces him to describe his code to others, correctly enter his code in the presence of others and learn shortcuts and different points of view.
